## Usage

### Running the App

### Language Switching

- All content updates instantly upon language change.

### Navigation

- Use the top navigation bar to access different sections and product dropdowns.
- The mobile menu is accessible on smaller screens.

### Example: Adding a New Language

1. Copy `src/i18n/en.ts` to a new file (e.g., `fr.ts` for French).
2. Translate all values.
3. Update `src/i18n/I18nContext.tsx` to include the new language.
4. Add the language option to the language toggle component.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No special environment variables are required for basic usage. For advanced configuration (e.g., analytics, API endpoints), add your variables to a `.env` file and reference them in your code as needed.

### Internationalization

- Translation files are located in `src/i18n/`.
- The current language is stored in `localStorage` and auto-detected on first visit.
- To add or update translations, edit the corresponding language file.

### Customization

- **Styling:** Modify or extend Tailwind CSS classes in component files or update `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Branding:** Update logo, colors, and content in the relevant components.
- **Navigation:** Edit `src/components/Navbar.tsx` and related files for menu structure.
