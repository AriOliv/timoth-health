# Endometriosis Early Detection Insights – Documentation

## Overview
This feature provides early detection insights for endometriosis using a rules-based AI algorithm. It is designed for use by healthcare professionals and patients, with a focus on privacy, transparency, and clinical reliability.

## 1. Algorithm Description

- **Type:** Rules-based scoring system (simulated AI for demo; can be replaced with ML model in production).
- **Inputs:**
  - Age
  - Pelvic/abdominal pain severity
  - Irregular menstrual cycles
  - Heavy menstrual bleeding
  - History of infertility
  - Family history of endometriosis
  - Imaging findings (ultrasound/MRI)
- **Logic:**
  - Each risk factor is assigned a score based on clinical relevance.
  - Total score determines risk level:
    - **High Risk:** ≥6 points
    - **Moderate Risk:** 3–5 points
    - **Low Risk:** 1–2 points
    - **No Significant Risk:** 0 points

## 2. Data Sources Required

- **Patient-reported data:** Age, symptoms, family history.
- **Clinical data:** Imaging findings (ultrasound/MRI).
- **No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored or transmitted.**

---

## 3. Validation Process

- **Clinical Basis:** Scoring system based on published risk factors and clinical guidelines for endometriosis.
- **Testing:** Algorithm tested with synthetic data to ensure correct risk stratification.
- **Transparency:** All logic is visible in the code and can be reviewed by clinicians.
- **Future:** For production, replace with a validated ML model trained on anonymized, consented patient datasets and externally validated.

## 4. Data Privacy & Compliance

- **HIPAA/GDPR:** No data is stored or transmitted; all processing is local.
- **Consent:** Explicit consent required before analysis.
- **Notice:** Privacy notice is displayed in the UI.

---

## 5. User Interface

- **Accessible, mobile-friendly form for data entry.**
- **Clear risk assessment and recommendations.**
- **Designed for both clinicians and patients.**

---

## 6. Limitations

- This is a demonstration and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
- The rules-based algorithm is for illustrative purposes only.
